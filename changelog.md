## Unreleased - Friday

### Product Direction

- Started the `Friday Reliable Workspace Core` 100% feature-set loop in `TODO.md`.
- Reframed progress tracking around concrete capability sets instead of near-complete vanity scores.

### Reliability

- Hardened workspace backup, restore, sync, provider health, provider research, web search, and web inspection status messages so blank failures do not surface as empty UI text.
- Added timestamped backup/export/import/sync status details for safer local-first recovery.

### New Features

- Added Vibe Coding settings for variable recognition, file tagging, and editor context.

- Added Wispr-style bulk file import for dictionary CSV/JSON and snippets JSON.
- Prevented Dictionary and Snippets from importing or saving overlapping trigger phrases.

- Added Wispr-style local data storage controls for transcript and transform history: store normally, auto-delete after 24 hours, or never store.
- Added a global Context Awareness privacy toggle for local style matching and coding hints.
- Added local coding post-processing for spoken file tags, extensions, paths, identifiers, and explicit backticks.
- Added transcript history paste-back into focused apps, including batch selected transcript paste.
