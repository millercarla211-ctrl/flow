## Building Locally

### macOS

**Prerequisites:** macOS 14+, [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) 1.74+, [Bun](https://bun.sh/) 1.3+, Xcode Command Line Tools
```bash
xcode-select --install
git clone https://github.com/LegendarySpy/Glimpse.git
cd Glimpse
bun install
```
```bash
bun tauri dev       # Development with hot reload
bun tauri build     # Production build
```

### Windows

**Prerequisites:** Windows 10/11, [Bun](https://bun.sh/) 1.3+, [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) with the MSVC toolchain, Visual Studio Build Tools with **Desktop development with C++** / MSVC, and the Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime.
```powershell
rustup default stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
git clone https://github.com/LegendarySpy/Glimpse.git
cd Glimpse
bun install
```
```powershell
bun tauri dev       # Development with hot reload
bun tauri build     # Production build
```

On Windows, `bun tauri ...` stores Cargo build artifacts in
`C:\.glimpse-cargo-target` to avoid long native build paths. Override with
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR` or `GLIMPSE_CARGO_TARGET_DIR` if needed in env.

> [!TIP]
> After a production build, you may need to re-enable accessibility permissions in System Settings for text insertion to work.
