## Privacy

Glimpse collects anonymous usage analytics via [Aptabase](https://aptabase.com/) to help improve the app. This includes:

- App launches and session duration
- Which transcription engine is used (local vs cloud)
- Model downloads and onboarding completion

**What's NOT collected:** transcription content, API keys, prompts, or any personally identifiable information.

Analytics are privacy-first and GDPR compliant. No opt-out is currently provided, but the data is fully anonymous. For full transparency, see [`src-tauri/src/analytics.rs`](src-tauri/src/analytics.rs) for exactly what's tracked.

## License

Glimpse is licensed under the **GNU Affero General Public License v3 (AGPL-3.0)**. You can self-host or modify it as long as changes remain open. A paid hosted option will be available for those who prefer a managed instance.
